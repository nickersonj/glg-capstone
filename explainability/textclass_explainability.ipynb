    "### Interpretation of Lime Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The above explainability output shows the predicted class and true class for a particular article number, as well as the explanation for each class. Note that **positive and negative signs** denote words that are positive or negative for a particular class, so it is possible that a particular word that is negative towards one class may be positive towards another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **healthcare**, we can see that its features are sports-related words (e.g., 'fans', 'nba', 'players', 'team') and that they are negatively inclined for the healthcare topic. It appears that the model is identifying healthcare articles by its lack of sports terms, as opposed to learning healthcare-related terminology. Some of these sports-related words (e.g., 'nba', 'players', 'team') show up as positive features for **sports**, as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is the case for **business**, **technology**, and **movies**, where we again see that sports-related terms such as 'players', 'fans', 'team', 'game', and 'nba' are strong negative features. One exception is that it appears that the model has learned that the term 'star' is positively associated with **movies**, which makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further improve our model, we may want to train with **additional articles for healthcare, business, technology, and movies** so that the model can better learn those classes. It would also be interesting to see how the model performs if sports articles are omitted completely; would the model still be able to differentiate between the remaining classes, given that sports-related terms are its top features?"

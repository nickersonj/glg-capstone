**Problem Definition:** 
GLG helps people make smarter decisions by connecting them to experts. Hundreds of requests are submitted daily to GLG via an intake form. GLG wants to help people reach experts faster by:
1. Grouping common topics together
2. Grouping similar client requests together
3. Identifying underlying patterns in the data (NER, time-based patterns)
